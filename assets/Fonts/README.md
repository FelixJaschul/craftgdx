# Fonts Directory

Place the Minecraft font file here with the name `minecraft.ttf`.

You can find Minecraft-style fonts online, such as:
- "Minecraft" font by Pwnage Block
- "Minecrafter" font by MadPixel

Make sure you have the proper license to use the font in your project.

If the Minecraft font is not available, the HUD will fall back to the default LibGDX font.
